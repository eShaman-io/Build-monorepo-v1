# GPT, Do The Work — Task Pack (A–F)
Use these exact tasks to generate assets with deterministic IDs and schema.

## A) Design brief → tokens/components
Create a tokens.json for eShaman based on brand guardrails. Include semantic and state tokens. Output tokens plus rationale. Define Button, Input, Card, Modal, Toast, Tabs with props and states. Include A11y notes.

## B) Framer hero section
Build a Framer hero wired to tokens with responsive layout, H1 + subtitle + CTA, subtle ritual visual. Lazy-load noncritical media. Add analytics events for view and CTA click. Provide a test report against performance and a11y budgets.

## C) Stripe setup
Generate Stripe CLI commands and dashboard configuration steps for subscriptions (Monthly/Annual), trial handling, taxes, receipts, webhooks, and a customer portal. Include a test matrix covering success/failure/SCA and downgrade flows.

## D) Ritual template: Decision Clarity
Produce a JSON schema and step-by-step script. Include inputs, timing, reflective prompts, completion messages, and safety rules. Provide 3 test inputs and expected outputs.

## E) Oracle Chat prompts
Write the base system prompt plus five focused assistant messages: grounding, conflict, burnout, creative block, sleep. Keep responses short, actionable, ethical, and non‑diagnostic.

## F) Firebase scaffold
Output Firestore rules, sample documents for each collection, and TypeScript types. Include one idempotent webhook handler for subscription updates with retry logic. Provide unit tests that prove rules enforce owner-only access.
