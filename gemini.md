Project: eShaman Monorepo
Scope

You are working inside this project repository. Do not create, modify, or delete files outside of this directory tree.

Respect .gitignore and .geminiignore files; ignored files should not be included in context or modified.

Coding guidelines

Use Node.js v20.17.0 as specified by .nvmrc. Generated code must be compatible with Node.js 20 and follow the existing coding style in the repository.

Match existing formatting conventions (e.g. two‑space indentation, semicolons) when creating or editing files.

Provide clear JSDoc comments for functions, classes, and exported modules.

Prefer functional paradigms where appropriate and avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.

Workflow

When asked to perform tasks that might change files or run shell commands, first plan the approach. Provide a step‑by‑step plan and ask for confirmation before executing any changes.

Use the run_shell_command tool responsibly and avoid dangerous operations (e.g. rm, git push, npm publish) unless explicitly instructed and confirmed.

When reading or analysing code, use list_directory, read_file, search_file_content or other file system tools to gather context.

Communication

Be concise and explicit in explanations. If you need more information, ask clarifying questions.

Summarise important findings and rationale before presenting a plan.

These guidelines help ensure that Gemini operates safely within this project and follows our coding practices.
